it\\'s not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. hopefully the champagne style pinot that was also sent will be more interesting. *\\ndoes wine travel well? this champagne seems to have. packing the car recently, i opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when i found -

although i\\'ve expanded slightly beyond that below. i wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making (carb. mac.?). there aren\\'t many wines i\\'ve poured down the sink, but this was one of them.\\nharsh and astringent. completely gone. no stars\\ni don\\'t want to be unfair to this wine (it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable lamaione), but this isn\\'t quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be -

ultimately fairly simple, yes - but it does have lovely round, sweet, leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft, amber-edged maturity.  so it\\'s easy to scoff in the other sense too. ***\\nsome will say this is past its peak but i rather like it. mature riesling apricot flavours, old wine roundedness, very pleasant. ***\\nquite big, ripe and sweet for spatlese.  very attractive, quite forward and engaging fruit.  very good rather than really riveting. top ***\\nquite big, ripe and rich.  this has a timeless quality -

a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style.   very pleasant drinking but not profound.   will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long-term wine. ***\\nvery (excessively even) citric, good acidity and a modest finish.  no sign of 96 oxidation.  i was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white burgundy -

never a bad sign.   on the palate, like a really fine old madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate.  the flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink.   top ***\\nchocolatey fruit - very nice old colheita. top ***\\n\\npossibly a touch too old now, but lovely old champagne nonetheless. mature and elegant for its depth. ****\\none of the first wines i bought with a view to keeping. i love old white burgundy, and this didn\\'t let me down. lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff. ****\\ndisappointing. not past it, but just not particularly special. maybe it still needs loads more time to develop? **\\nlovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. drinking very well. silky. *****\\nok, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. the label wasn\\'t in the best condition. the next morning i was just sorting through the corks when i noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. the last time i had this wine i was disappointed, and i was again this time. it\\'s ok, but it hasn\\'t got the structure or depth expected. ***\\n\\nstylish nose, slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate. pleasant. *\\nslightly flat, flavoursome,  a bit rustic. interesting, up to a point.  *\\nrich fruit. lovely burgundy.   good intensity and structure.  needs time.  top ***(*)\\nmothbally at first. disjointed but intense palate.  emerges -

this though seems rather good: provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box.   very much a point and it has kept well.  a little simple perhaps but i believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property.   good effort - i\\'d like to try some other vintages. ***\\nquite concentrated and flavoursome, but lacking finesse for me in a way that i\\'m not sure more time will alleviate.  pleasant then but not  fantastic. ***\\nsmoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable. ***\\nblackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours, very stylish indeed.   will probably improve for a year or two.  ***\\na bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains.  still, quite a dense, brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something.   good rather than exceptional. ***\\nfruity, grassy - like a new world semillon.  pleasant enough. *\\nnice fruit quality - quite suave.  decent length.  top *\\nvery fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay.  very refined texture and good length.   once it has been open a while it seems even more burgundian.  it needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding.  scrapes ****\\nslate, sherbert, a touch sour as msr wines can be.  good length, maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something i find occasionally with the vintage.  fine, but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain.  top ***\\nquite tight and closed, but opens out with time as it warms up.  excellent intensity and a long brioche finish.  good balance.  ****(*)\\nvery thin and dull.  drinkable but no stars\\n\\nmodern-styled, but very nicely done.   limey acidity.  satisfying, but completely upstaged by the jobard that follows.  ***\\nmore reserved, but much more complexity and \"beyond-fruit\" flavours.   excellent.  ***(*)\\ndry, reserved, quite persistent. rather good.  bare ***(*)\\noxidised - but it did have a slightly loose cork. not rated\\nsofter and rounder than the lafarge below.  still quite piquant on the palate.   ***\\ndry, fragrant, good length.  fairly austere at first and less flattering than the jadot wine.  might till improve touch, while the jadot is ready.  ***\\nopen 24 hours.  seems good. quite mineral.  ***\\n\\nsold to me in oddbins as the wine that beat dom perignon in a recent competition. actually it might have been the nv blin that did this -
